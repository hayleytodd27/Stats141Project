# Stats141Project

This was part of the final project done for my Statistics 141 class at UCLA, in which we were asked to analyze surveryed data and an end-of-year survey, and discover any interesting changes or relationships. Through my code provided, I focused on the written answer questions within the survey, and performed a text mining analysis to examine which words were most used among the class, and examine any potential differences between different demographic groups. My skills most displayed here are data cleaning, exploratory analysis, text mining, ggplot, and word cloud creation.
