SEAN1,"This course beautifally balanced between diversity and statistics. not only did I learn alot about diversity and its importance, but I also learned how to test it and prove its significance statistically through pure data analysis.",insightful enjoyable interesting detailed beautiful,"maybe combine labs to group projects, simply for students to have less different deadlines for different projects."
SEAN2,,,
SEAN3,"Getting to be able to hear from the guest speakers were an interesting opportunity for me. While they were not from statistical backgrounds, they demonstrated good methodology of studies and surveys to discuss their discipline / work responsibilities.",awareness groupwork positive disjointed applicable,Lab/Homework assignments for statistic majors felt very disjointed with the rest of the course.
SEAN4,"Very much enjoyed guest lectures, & applied problem solving in the group HWs, as well as the positive/fun atmosphere in the class.",easy simple positive fun relevant applicable crossdisciplinary grouporiented,Organization of course materials & documents.
SEAN5,Applications of statistics to enhance and promote diversity on campus.,motivational interesting analytical informative helpful,I think the professor can assign some individual works other than the group work we already have.
SEAN6,"We often talk about diversity, but we rarely look at it from a statistics point of view and how to criticallly analyze the issue with support from data. It is very interesting to be able to look at the issue of diversity quantatively, especially since we are using real datasets. I definitely have a deeper understanding on the issues of diversity surrounding me and the world at large.",mindopening meaningful unique informative fun,
SEAN7,I think the speech are very interesting. Every speaker from the speech are knowledgeble. I really learned a lot from each speech.,stats R group openinternet openbook,I think some of the metrial from class can be PDF format.
HENNA1,This course teaches me how to integrate statistics into the real life situations.,resourceful good meaningful helpful easy,Invite more guest speakers
HENNA2,"This class gives me a new scene of diversity of world and campus that I had never noticed before, which is my favorite part of this class. Besides, the course material shows me what the statistics can be used in real life, I see more possibilities of this major. And of course this class gives me the ability to build model and analysis, which makes it academically helpful to me. And I think the materials provided mostly based on data in real world, which is more practical, more like the real reasearch we'll do in the fture.",special wide interesting practical open,The pace of lectures is a little slow. I hope the professor could cover more material or do some extension based on material in class.
HENNA3,"As stat major student, this course more like a review of all stat class I taken before It's helpful to help me remember what did I learned before.",review complex groupwork homework reactionpaper,Nothing
HENNA4,,,
HENNA5,,,
HENNA6,knowing more about R program which can be used in real society,fun brain math hard good,calculation skill
HENNA7,It helps me learn more about how to integrate social sciences and statistics. I would like to continue using quantitative methods or tools to solve problems in other subject areas or industries.,interactive integrative diverse teamwork notthathard,"I feel like open notes/books/internet makes exams easier than expected, such that it may encourage students to prepare tons of materials to search from instead of actually learning."
JOANNA1,"This class definitely helped me grow in patience in working with other people due to the all of the group work. It also taught me how to study and learn independently, while drawing upon the available resources.",,The organization of the course and course materials. Integration of statistics and diversity felt very minimal.
JOANNA2,One of the speaker taled about the difference in equality and equity,interesting easycourse diversity helpful,The stats part and diversity part for this course seems not well combined that I have trouble to apply stats knowledge to the part of diversity
JOANNA3,"I have never noticed micro-regression before, after learning this concept, I started to pay more attention to the way how I talk to people, try to make people not feeling bad b/c of some of my behaviors.",statistics diversity groupwork regression fun,More conceptual explanation would be better
JOANNA4,Performing multilinear regression on the data to gain some insight of relationship between variables really interested me. And the first guest speaker gives me a lot of thoughts about diversity from the perspective of immigrants,diversity teamwork application interpretation statistics,"The form of teamwork creates a platform, but it doesn't work as expected because people put in less amount of effort in a group work. Better if we can choose who to work with."
JOANNA5,I was able to use R at stat analyses in a research project to consider the effect of data,important complicated goodpace interesting insightful,No stats/non-stats. This should be a non-stats class & concepts/symbol names shouldn't be assumed
JOANNA6,It helps me truly understand what diversity means and review some statistical concepts I learned.,diversed statistics interesting fastpaced intensive,"There are some typos in the lecture notes, and this may leads to confusion for those who are not familiar with statistical concepts."
JOANNA7,,,
BREANNA1,The fact that this course tightly relates stat to R progamm9ng makes the class very practical that it helps (especially) non-stats major students a lot.,modeling diversity concept programming engagement,"Although it's guest speakers are very helpful in conveying messages about diversity, they do not really ""make"" students more successful in the course. It was difficult (especially nonstat major (for me, I personally had o knowledge in R)) to do homeworks at the beginning. Homework groups help; but not much. "
BREANNA2,,,"Less usage on RStudio, as it maybe difficult for non-stat major students"
BREANNA3,Working on the reaction paper and Hws with my group member definitely helps improve my interpersonal skills,respect diversity understanding cooperation communication,The reaction papers re less effective 
BREANNA4,,,It could be more organized 
BREANNA5,The homework made me really understand the concept of linear regression. And it's really helpful for preparing for my exams.,fun meaningful helpful respectful happy,"Sometimes, the notes can get a little bit confused disorganized and small amount of typo. Other than that, this class is fun and helpful."
BREANNA6,This course prepare me for the stats learning for next quarter. and it's pretty helpful,interesting teamwork diversity advance helpful,The speed of class should be slower.
BREANNA7,It brought to my attention how diversity really comes into effect in schools. I like the group work because it allows you to meet new people and branch out. I was able to better my understanding of statistics.,interesting diverse computers collaborative meaningful,Things that can be improved are I think the minor errors on exams with spelling or grammar 
MAYRA1,,,
MAYRA2,,,
MAYRA3,It helps me to understand research question in more realistic context so that I learn to solve real worl problems. ,interesting meaningful diverse different fun,The lab works can be more closely related to the course material
MAYRA4,,,
MAYRA5,"I learned teamwork with members from worldwide and meet so many issus, I learned a lot.",stats team diverse enjoy relax,Notes post on CCLE in organized.
MAYRA6,The most positive effect this course had towards me is to learn how to listen and gain an understanding about diversity in many different points of views through guest speaker seminar.,fun diverse communication stats easy,Lecture notes are a bit disorganized(bit of typos).
MAYRA7,I enjoyed the diverse talks and powerpoints. It really opens your eyes to the world and is greater than material memorized in class.,intriguing complicated effort diverse coding,"we worked ay yer o R then didn't need it for the test, felt like all work but midterm and final was on K"
ZEYUAN1,"I like that we were divided into HW Groups. I feel like it encourages people to work together. Some student may be too shy to ask others for help when they need it, and the hw group kind of breaks down this barrier. It's also a good feeling when you help another student understand a topic",diversity microagression statistics toomuchinformation interesting,Maybe just one group for both HW and reaction paper. Also wait until second week to put people in groups. A lot of people drop or enroll during first week. A lot of hassle.
ZEYUAN2,Working on HW assignments and Reaction Papers as a group practiced my communication skills throug the course.,interesting diversity comprehensive meaningful insight,Lectures and notes could be more organized.
ZEYUAN3,"I like the diversity element more than anything, particularly Susan Phillipos talk.",fantasting dense flexible encouraging review,Please less typos
ZEYUAN4,I choose this class as a way of fulfilling my diversity requirement and learning critical statistical skills. I enjoyed labs with math.,MLR diversity SLR challenging ideas,The tutor have a bit of errors in class. Also the lecture on SLR could be revised.
ZEYUAN5,"I hadn't heard of micro-aggression prior to this course. Learning about it, and talking with my peers helped me understand the impact. Now, I'm more careful as to consider other peoples backgrounds in how they may interpret my actions. ",meaningful interesting applicantdriven handson fun,"I would ask for pdf versions of the notes, as they don't load correctly without microsoft word."
ZEYUAN6,,,
ZEYUAN7,"It helps reinforce the concepts I learnt from other class. For exmaple, I was taking 100B as well. The materials are kind of helpful. ",diversity graph interpretation linearregression niceprofessor,Try to make every file as a pdf version.
HAYLEY1,"This course helped me pay attention to more in depth diversity. We had a guest speaker come in and talk about the lack of disabled persons in PhD programs, and I would have never thought that an education system could use one's disability to separate them.",,The group assignments are really difficult to coordinate. My groups for both homework and reaction assignments were very unresponsive. I ended up having to do all the homework assignments myself.
HAYLEY2,Lesson on microaggression really had an impact where I will not my choice of word more cautious.,managable interesting groupwork thinkoutofthebox atypical,Code and plots in word is hard to see. I think rmarkdown to pdf/html is better for visualization.
HAYLEY3,"I really loved how much the professor engaged with students during class, asked questions, and made sure we were following along. I also loved how she would write on the board and type out solutions because it was a good speed and helped me to keep up and take-in the infor. Also, I loved how she would summarize the lecture at the end. Ultimately, this course gives me confidence to tackle real-world issues! I was nervous to take a stats course, but I am proud of my accomplishment. I also learned a lot about working with others.",realworld applicable welcoming important basicstats,"There were a few instances where lectures/notes were unclear/had mistakes. Also, the odds ratio lesson should be improved, as I know many students did not really understand and there were mixed messages."
HAYLEY4,"It made me examine my own behavior and beliefs, and forced me to see how damaging a few years of focusing on race can be, and how destructive firmly holding on to a different identity can be. It did give me some nice insight on statistical data that comes up frequently in politics, but it primarily taught me that while I don't need to be concerned about being different, I don't need to be proud of it, either. Nor should I be. ",application realworld handson training forcedideology,"While I respect the fact that some people think equity is a great idea, it drives more conservative students like me nuts. I appreciate how neutral the class itself was, but some speakers pushed political opinions as goals."
HAYLEY5,Teamwork in the assignments,smart informative caring challenging useful,"No graders, TA's should grade papers since we are able to ask why we get certain answers wrong. "
HAYLEY6,,,
HAYLEY7,"In terms of problem solving skills, there was enough of managing ambiguity and tackling enough challenging questions that allowed me to understand problems well and give me the opportunity to venture out and find what it is I didn't know, where my weaknesses were and how to improve.",fun engaging teambuilding handson friendly,Homework assignments are sometimes unclear.
HAYLEY8,I loved the guest speakers because it gave us a sense of how the material we were learning was applied to real life. I really appreciated the reaction papers as a way to reflect but would have enjoyed discussing more the topic. I really enjoyed the discussions we would have in class on certain issues and getting everyone's opinion.,interesting fantastic thoughtprovoking diverse inclusive,I believe that the group work can be improved because I feel as if I didn't learn all the material because it was split up amongst four members.
KELLIE1,"This course had a positive effect on my motivation to learn a subject matter outside of my expertise. It challenged me to be able to connect different aspects of what I was learning together. Learning stats feel like learning a new language, but the assignments and group work to left me motivated to learn.",challenging diverse enjoyable teamoriented interesting,The lecture slides and homework assignments could be clearer.
KELLIE2,This course provides a safe space for students to recognize real world diversity issues while at the same time challenge our statistical understanding with outside variables.,interesting openminded overwhelming complex diverse,"Organize Notes, less typos, enforce everyone to do homework and turn it in."
KELLIE3,"I learned how to use ""R"" to solve RL problem and I can feel that ""R"" is a power tool in statistics.",,"Maybe can teach more ""code"" in ""R""."
KELLIE4,Guest speaks were meaning.,difficult lost hard,Too hard for non stats major student. & Too much work.
KELLIE5,I liked how the exams were straightforward and not tricky. They tested knowledge from the hw and Professor Esfandiari did a good job in drilling the topics.,straightforward R sometimesdisorganized impactful interesting,"Organization of lecture notes, hw, etc. Very hard to find things on CCLE. HW for stats majors are meant for seniors, not juniors who have not take upper division stats courses."
KELLIE6,"I am very impressived by what the guest speakers encountered, especially Professor Gariers. He dropped out of school and went back 2 years after, and at the end, he is such successful now.",diverse stats homework lab reaction,Less homework and paper T.T.
KELLIE7,I had never thought of diversity as such a big matter before I was taking this class.,diversity fun interesting helpful collaboration,
EVELYN1,The most positive effect is I learn how to work with others in a team. It is the first time I work in a teamwith completely strangers and by working together. I learn we should be all responsible for our parts either as an individual or a team.,interesting motivating welcoming joyful vivacious,No idea yet
EVELYN2,,,
EVELYN3,"Since I'm a third year stats major student, I haven't learned much statistical knowledge.This class really gives me a preview and makes me more interested in statistical application.",nice useful,
EVELYN4,"The course's teachingstyle helps me in breaking down concepts into moredigestible chunks. The TA played a crucial role in understanding the math behind the formulas. The TA also pushes students to go beyond the lecture, which I appreciate. The professor is excellent at her pace, making sure that concepts get accross clearly. All these contribute to making me more curious in my learning.",useful fair manageable goodmixofspeakersandmaterial,"Application could be more interesting. Apart from the speakers, our work in class is simply stats with data on diversity. I personally did not feel the diversity part come to life, compared to the statistics part. Maybe instead of reaction papers, which I think can only represent writing but not really actively encouraging diversity, students can have a cumulative project instad, of their topic of interest related to diversity."
EVELYN5,"Because I am a North campus major with very north campu minors, I did not learn too much about diversity that I did not already know, but it did show me the more in depth statistically look into that diversity that I was already aware of. What this class really taught me was that I need to take ownership and responsibility for my own learning. I need to attend, stay focused and ask questions, not sit by and watch it pass me. This has definitely been more than just a math class for me though.",math abound diversity for humanities,- maybe add clicker questions for more student participation in the class (ppl didn't really answer) - add another speaker that shows more with the later concepts
EVELYN6,The course involves guest speakers and reaction papers that really incorporate statistics and diversity concepts and forces the class to think about them deeply.,practicality cooperation diversity independentlearning innovation,The materials could be more clearly organized and structured so we could better see the connection among knowledge and diversity concepts.
EVELYN7,I have been questionable about where my quantitative skills could be put into use. but throughout this course I've learned how to do a lot of things that would help me to understand the world around me in a more scientific way.,eyeopening enlighting enjoyable practical worthit,I would love to see more guest speakers.
